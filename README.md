# GitHub Users Scraper

- This project uses Python to scrape user data from GitHub, specifically targeting users located in Bangalore with more than 100 followers, utilizing the GitHub API and a personal access token for authentication. 

- After analyzing the data, I discovered that a surprising number of users had unique skill sets, with many having public repositories focused on cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and blockchain. 

- Developers should consider implementing data scraping practices to analyze user profiles and trends on GitHub, as this could lead to valuable insights for project collaborations and networking opportunities.
